<p>Software as a Service (SaaS) is a very interesting business model model. With a subscription system at its core, SaaS revenue doesn’t come from new costumers only – it makes sense to focus on building a great product for your existing customers, too. Another highly fascinating aspect about SaaS lies in their cost structure: there are very low – if any – per-item-costs. While you need personnel to build, improve and scale it, this still makes it cheap compared to the cost structures of so many other businesses, where you might have to buy expensive special vehicles and tools and pay for per-item materials. As the term says, it is a service business and a highly cost-efficient scaling one, too.</p>
<p>Unlike other software business, SaaS is barely about comparing lists of features for the customer – as every software and its service isn’t only unique but also fast and quick to enhance. Most likely you have a unique feature or way of doing things that differentiate you, while your competition might has offers, you don’t need or want to have. Which makes a customers a perfect fit for you. In the service industry you always want to convince your customers with another argument than "being cheaper" – and so want your competitors, by the way.</p>
<p>Running a software in this the service industry means, you are not bound to have to think about pricing in a competitive manner nor do you have any costs forcing you to structure the pricing around them. Setting the price for a SaaS is totally in your hands, which makes it a game of psychology. One of high importance even, as it is a key factor whether people can, effort and want to pay for it. The beauty of it though, once you’ve found the target, it will sell like hot cake. On top, you have basically no costs on upselling them further either. We’ll come back to that later.</p>
