<p>SaaS product have a few more spins to it though. Another one is its ability to be repackaged into essentially any size for no further costs. You can sell the same thing just in three or four different sizes. Thus allowing you to have an offer for each budget size.</p>
<p>With its low costs, this is a key instrument in SaaS pricing: have multiple tiers. But be aware to give only a few. Offering too many makes the choice harder: there is too much to read and compare making it hard to decide which is the best solution – a fundamental problem with crowd funding pricing. Tiers instead should be comparable on one page, their differences and benefits clearly distinguishable making it easy to find that tier that fits the customer the best. In my experiences three pricing levels work the best - some argue it’s five, but I often feel that is too much to read (and you’d need five clear differentiations).</p>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a id="_how_low_can_you_go"></a>How low can you go?</h3></div></div></div>

<p>The lowest priced tiers is the one, you’ll use for advertising and marketing. Try to make it as low as you can reason without having the feeling of selling out cheap. This is also the (only) tier you offer a free trial with. Both of these measures make it easier for people to start using your product. By making it fairly inexpensive it also has fewer cancellation. Even if people decide to not stick with your product, a price of for e.g. €9.99/month doesn’t feel like the trouble of trying to cancel (don’t make it hard to cancel though!). So, go as low as you can and still feel comfortable and make some money with.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a id="_too_thin"></a>Too thin</h3></div></div></div>

<p>Your real costumers won’t use it anyways, as that tier is too lightweight for them. The lowest offer shouldn’t be bad or cheesy, but don’t forget it is your marketing pricing to get people to look into your service, to try it out and hook them on it. This tier therefore should deliver "just not quiet enough" yet. If you’ve any reasonable idea of your business, you can probably tell right on the spot what is require to make it enough for your customers – otherwise do some market research. Maybe they’ll run through ten clients a month, then if only eight are included in your lowest tier or they are running a radio stream with music so they need 192kb/s mp3, then that tier supports only up to 128kb, if they have revenue of 15k per month, this tier allows up to 10k – you get the picture.</p>
<p>It should be obvious that this tier isn’t quiet enough for them. Don’t shout it into their face nor make it a completely useless offer, but use terms and numbers they understand. They should have the feeling it isn’t sufficient for what they need. For a very simple reason: when they are checking your pricing this thoroughly, they’ve looked through your promo page are interested in your service and most likely want to use it. If they just want to try it, these numbers don’t mean much. They’ll hit the "free trial button" without wasting another look at it. But when they come back, after maybe having tried it and others, and do take the time to go through your offer thoroughly, you’ve already won. They are sold. Now you only need to settle on the price with them. And by making the cheapest solution unusable to them, they immediately move to the second tier, not even questioning whether another competition might be better at the same price. And it also gives them a slight satisfactory feeling of "being higher than just somebody".</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a id="_the_second_is_good_the_third_is_to_settle"></a>The second is good, the third is to settle</h3></div></div></div>

<p>Now the second tier offers much more than the lowest one we’ve talked about. Not only can they run their business with it, but it is almost too generous, offers more than they ever feel to be needing. For just about double the initial price (or slightly less) - it’s a very good. It is in the price range they want to and <span class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> settle. But they don’t. By offering so much already – essentially all they ever wanted – they’ve become curious about what more you could be offering. And they’ll have a look at the third tier and compare it to the second.</p>
<p>Now it gets interesting. By having a price slightly higher than the second tier but adding something extra-ordinary - even if they don’t necessarily need it - the offer will be very interesting to them. Because you are offering so much more in the third in comparison to tier two while it isn’t even that much more expensive. Comparing them it actually feels like a really good offer, you get more for your money. In my experience, the best way to achieve this is by adding exactly one major, key feature on top (aside from appropriate scaling parameters). Like in the former mentioned audio-stream example, add a second stream - it adds a lot feature but got "thrown in" rather cheap. Much cheaper than buying a second tier two.</p>

<h3 class="title">The psychology behind this</h3>

<p>has been explained very well by <a class="ulink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOhb4LwAaJk" target="_top">Dan Ariely on youtube</a>: we don’t know our preferences that well and therefore are receptive to influences like supposedly good offers in comparison to another.</p>

<a id="_real_world_case"></a>Real world case</h3></div></div></div>

<p>I did exactly this pricing range for a crowd funding campaign of a Hollywood movie. We’ve put it to exactly these tiers:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
9.95 € - you were thanked on the website, got access to the bonus material and live updates through the websites about the production, as well as a download-link for the movie as soon as it gets released on Bluray
</li>
<li>
29.95 € - Same as before, but you’d also be mentioned in the credits of the movie.
</li>
<li>
49.95 € - Aside from the news updates, being mentioned in the credits, you’d also be receiving a real disc version of the Bluray.
</li>
</ul></div>

<p>This allowed the studio to advertise with "support this movie starting from 9.95€". But the real deal was, getting mentioned in the movie, so people were immediately checking the second tier as the first didn’t offer this at all. And though many settled on this, for less than double the price, you’d also receive a Bluray - well, doesn’t that sound great?</p>
<p>So thought 57% of the customer (while 21% went for the first and 22% for the second option). We sold them a Bluray disc for 50€. One movie - not a DVD-set. A movie could already have access to through a download link to for twenty Euros less. A Bluray discs, which costs essentially nothing in production (which is why the producers wanted to offer it as part of the lowest pricing range initially). We wouldn’t have gotten anyone to pay for this, if I had said it this way. But through this pricing schema, we could. And the customers were happy to do so.</p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">This is a Kickstarter-like campaign</h3>

<p>Given, this is not a reoccurring subscription but a fan-driven one-time transaction also selling the fact, that you are taking part in getting something done that "without you wouldn’t happen", so people are generally more generous.</p>
<p>But using a similar pricing scheme with 19.90€, 29.90€ and 39.90€ does have similar effects on a subscription basis.</p>

<a id="_ending_with_the_nine"></a>Ending with the Nine</h3></div></div></div>

<p>I’ve very bluntly ignored the discussing of the pricing numbers. You might have noticed I’ve only presented you cases ending on nine. If you are little familiar with the subject, you know that we don’t exactly know why, but having the price end with a nine outsells every other option (with five and seven right behind, but off by far). This has been shown in a series of studies, like <a class="ulink" href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1023581927405" target="_top">this one from MIT</a> and discussed in detail in books like <a class="ulink" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/080909469X/ref=cm_sw_su_dp" target="_top">"Priceless" by William Poundstone</a> <sup>[<a id="d4e88" href="#ftn.d4e88" class="footnote">1</a>]</sup>. If you want more detail on that, I recommend reading those for further insight.</p>

<a id="_enterprise_ain_t_part_of_this"></a>Enterprise ain’t part of this</h3></div></div></div>

<p>The described applies as long as you are mainly talking to end-consumers, small- and mid-size businesses but not for enterprise. The basic rule goes like this: if the company is big enough to employ someone, who’s main job it is to buy these services, they’ll call you up and ask to negotiate a custom pricing tier with you. And even if it’s only to justify the existence of their job (as they have work to do: negotiate with you), believe me, they’ll do it.Which costs extra effort on your side in compared to auto-serviced customers, signing up through the website, so don’t forget to charge them for it, too.</p>
<p>If you expect Corporate Customers, add another box on the bottom (or somewhere clearly off the comparison table) saying you are open to discuss further models and individual pricing for bigger customers or special areas (like non-profits or education, like Google is doing). During the negotiation you then go from two simultaneous stream to ten and add a big support package on top, that you sell for at least ten times the price you have on your highest tiers. That at least puts it back into the price-range that enterprise is used to deal with and happy talk to about: they really rather buy the service for 5.000€ than for 50€ as the later is harder to justify to be employed for.</p>
<p>That is also why even your highest priced tier does have some limits to it: otherwise you’d have nothing to sell to enterprise and high-class customers. Even if during negotiations you settle for eight times the highest tier so they feel they "won" the negotiation with you, it was worth the effort for you. But don’t ever think that this is an option to include via a one-click sign-up. Enterprises don’t do one-click-sign-up.</p>
