== Introduction ==

Welcome to this short guide on pricing Software as a Service (Saas). The main goal of the guide is to help you decide how to create different packages for your service and what to charge for each -  without getting lost in all the buzzwords. It'll start by laying down the basics and then looks at successful software providers for further examples. 

This guide is for you if you have just written some software that you would like to provide as a service, but you have little experience with selling. If you have no idea what SaaS is, you may want to start reading up on that first!

Before we start, for those of you who are not big on reading, for 80% of the cases the optimal price for your service will be â‚¬29.95/month ($36.95/month). This guide will explain you why and for which cases it is different. But if you don't care and just want a number, odds are, this is the number you want.

Enjoy.
