<p>I’ve mentioned upselling within SaaS-Product before – it’s one of the most beautiful aspects of it. The greatest thing is about upselling SaaS is it . And though we discussed before that a good pricing strategy on the overview page can already move people into settling for the more expensive tier, there is more to upsell with. Sadly, upselling has been abused in the past, like airlines tricking you into getting a "travel insurance" by already checking the field for you. To some it has a bad taste to it – for good reason, that behavior is pretty upsetting to anyone. Which is really not the first experience you want to have starting to do business with your customers. Understand that the upsell is still part of the first experience chain and getting this right is important.</p>
<p>One company that does upselling very right is Apple. Like everything in the selling chain, it is the right the communication and presentation to the other party that decides whether it works or not. And though Apple sells end-consumer hardware, the principles we’ll look at still apply to the upselling of SaaS products during the initial checkout. Let’s see how they do it.</p>
<div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_case_study_upselling_like_apple"/>Case Study: Upselling like Apple</h3></div></div></div>

<p>When you go to the Apple online store to buy a new MacBook Air (as an example), you are presented with different models. You should immediately notice the resemblance to our "packages" or "tiers" as described before:</p>
<div class="figure"><a id="d4e103"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 1. Selecting a Macbook Air</b></p><div class="figure-contents">

  <div class="mediaobject"><img src="image/page-1-above-fold.png" alt="A Screenshot of the Macbook Air Selection"/></div>
</div></div><br class="figure-break"/>

<p>There are just a few things different in these options, but they make for a big distinction: the first being the Screen size (either 11 inch or 13), the second being the amount of flash storage. By presenting those bluntly, Apple changes the conversation to <span class="emphasis"><em>which one to buy</em></span> based on raising the question of the appropriate the screen size — which they do very clever by having the second screen even be presented bigger — and in the secondary stage about the storage. First you pick the screen size, then the storage and then you are presented with the price. That way, the price is merely a result of our decisions and wasn’t part of the decision in the first place.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve decided what you want, you don’t really care that Apple is selling you 128GB of storage for 200EUR extra. Because this is what you wanted, you are happy with it and very few people will ever realise. But it gets even better. Once you have selecting this one, Apple presents you with the "configuration page", a second page to actually upsell you even more stuff in a very clever way.</p>
<div class="figure"><a id="d4e113"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 2. The "configuration" page</b></p><div class="figure-contents">

  <div class="mediaobject"><img src="image/apple-store-page-2.png" alt="The configuration screen"/></div>
</div></div><br class="figure-break"/>

<p>Sure, you need this to configure the CPU, memory and keyboard (which you probably want to do) but there is plenty of things listed, which are solely about selling you more things: how is an external screen, an AppleTV or a Printer part of a MacBook Air configuration? Well, it isn’t.</p>
<p>But by having this second "configuration"-screen, Apple does something very smart. It took the question which package to pick out of the scope. That decision has been done, the other options are of no more relevant. By splitting the process into two pages, you don’t have to bother about comparing prices of the configuration to other packages. Adding 8GB of RAM on a 13-inch could potentially cost more than on the 11-inch (which could even have plausible, technical reasons), but no costumer would ever go back and check. Because picking another general package isn’t of question any more.</p>
<p>Another thing you’ve hopefully noticed is the way this is presented: Apple takes four-fifth of the width to focus on the configuration. The summary of what you’ve selected on the other hand is just a tiny part on the right. And though it is showing the total price, always stays with the user and as such gives them total transparency about their choices, by keeping it to the top right, we are less likely to look at it or at least not until we’ve scrolled down the main part totally already.</p>
<p>By splitting the configuration into big chunks that basically cover the better part of your screen while you scroll, each upgrade becomes separate from the others, making them appear as individual, not too expensive choices. And one has to actively decide on each one. Making them appear separate visually, also separates the decision into individual smaller ones: looking at the mini-display-port-cable has nothing to do with the fact that one just agreed to buy the Thunderbold. Look it’s only 29,99€. In the customers brain the other decision has been processed and labelled as done. And though one might just want the mini-display-port, the customer is less likely to go back and change his mind on items before in the list.</p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Default is "None"</h3>

<p>One major flaw that many (airlines) do, is preselecting upsell-options and forcing the user to actively remove the selection in an often complicated way. Tricking a customer into upselling is an obvious way to have more people upsell in the short time but drives the customer angry and educates them you aren’t a trustworthy party. This isn’t working in the long-term.</p>
<p>Unlike how Apple is doing it here, making it clear you don’t get tricked into buying anything you don’t want by communicating: "It is your choice. We are happy either way. We just think <span class="emphasis"><em>this</em></span> might be of interest to you, too." And the customer listens. And they buy. And they are happy about it.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_the_upsell"/>The upsell</h4></div></div></div>

<p>Let’s take a look at the individual things Apple tries to sell here. The same as before with the overview product page, upselling appeals to the user, it looks good, is interesting and gets quite some space. By giving upselling so much room, Apple has enough space to present the product, all important information and list the options. Just scrolling over them is going to take a little while and at least one is going to catch ones eye.</p>
<p>Once again, how it is presented, is of high importance. Let’s take this external storage as an example:</p>
<div class="figure"><a id="d4e133"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 3. Upselling you the Thunderbold storage</b></p><div class="figure-contents">

  <div class="mediaobject"><img src="image/page-2-storage-none.png" alt="Thunderbold Storage"/></div>
</div></div><br class="figure-break"/>

<p>Not only does it have a lot of room and scrolling over it takes long enough for our eye to catch a glimpse and the brain to notice the content, but also the process of coming to a decision is similar as before. By presenting the price in square brackets it appears to be merely a consequence of the decision rather than part of it. Now, the details of the option one selected are in foreground. And it gets even better. Apple isn’t done upselling once you selected an option:</p>
<div class="figure"><a id="d4e141"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 4. After selecting an option, the price disappears</b></p><div class="figure-contents">

  <div class="mediaobject"><img src="image/page-2-storage-selected.png" alt="Selected a Storage"/></div>
</div></div><br class="figure-break"/>

<p>Did you notice the difference? Apple changed the prices. As one decided on an option, not only does it become part of the decision (and the summary) so the price disappears, also the other prices are updated to only show the difference in pricing. Genius. Just genius. For ones because the more expensive options don’t appear to be as expensive any longer but also because by phrasing it "Subtract 349,95€", even the "None" option now appears to be costing something. This is triggered by providing a positive number here. Our brain immediately notices that as high, while the meaning of "substract" and the act of negating it takes more time and effort.</p>
<p>Generally thinking of the negative is hard for human brains, by using words alongside the numbers other parts of the brain are required to process it, making it even harder. It would be very different if instead of "subtract", it would show the minus sign or – even worse the colour-codes red and green - things our brain would understand much faster and with less processing power. But by making it harder to process, customers are more likely to stick with the selection or even chose another one that feels less expensive now. Again, Apple changed the conversation away from the price to "how about a little more?".</p>

<div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_what_to_upsell"/>What to upsell</h3></div></div></div>

<p>In order to be able to upsell, you need to know your numbers obviously. For upselling but those features, people think they need or want but which are slightly outside of the main product, are of interest. Going back to our former case of audio streaming, one example is buying an upgrade to stream 256kb/s instead of just up to 192kb/s per radio stream. Or even offering 320kb/s as the ultimate upgrade, making professional DJs uber-happy to be able to offer the best quality though the real effect for most listeners wouldn’t change after 192kb/s.</p>
<p>An upsell is always the question of what you <span class="emphasis"><em>need</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>want</em></span> and might <span class="emphasis"><em>want to need</em></span>. Like in the Apple example, selling video adapters and printers just makes a lot of sense. One is buying the laptop with specific needs in mind. And by showing those options one is reminded about the purpose of, for e.g.,  showing presentations at conferences requiring an the adapter.</p>
<p>Another example that comes from the radio service I mentioned before, is about one specific feature, which actually costs the service almost nothing and was a default for long time but is something very easy and cheap to upsell with: stream to shoutcast service. Shoutcast is an external server that would then handle the distribution of the streams, resulting in your service only having to offer one output stream – making it technically cheaper to offer your service. But as many (if not all) other providers forbid these kind of features to enable a lock-in effect, enabling this feature would be classic thing to upsell with. Not only because more people think they need it than actually ever use it but also as the numbers show plenty people do use it instead of taking the more expensive tier with more streams.</p>
<p>By having to buy this feature extra on the second page, people are very likely be willing to pay a higher total than just getting a tier that costs more but includes more streams and would cover that, too. People pay for control and convenience.</p>
